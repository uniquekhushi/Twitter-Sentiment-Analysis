# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Developed a project to analyze the tweets and categorize them into sentiments - Positive , Negative and Neutral

Twitter sentiment analysis analyses the sentiment or emotion of tweets. It uses natural
language processing and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets automatically as
positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. It can be done for individual tweets or a
larger dataset related to a particular topic or event.

4-Text : The texture that view that person has shared.
